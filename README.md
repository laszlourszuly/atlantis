The Atlantis library will aid you in mocking the Internet for your Android app. It offers means of delivering custom tailored responses to network requests made by your app, without forcing you to do massive changes to your code.

The "News" section in [the Wiki](https://github.com/echsylon/atlantis/wiki) holds a rough change list. You can also get a quick-n-dirty introduction to Atlantis in the "How to" section, or have a look at the [JSON configuration reference](https://github.com/echsylon/atlantis/wiki/JSON-Configuration-File) and the [JavaDoc](http://echsylon.github.io/atlantis/javadoc/index.html) documentation for more technically detailed information in the "Reference" section.

If you want even more love, you could check out the [Atlantis Extra](https://github.com/echsylon/atlantis-extra/wiki) integration layer as well. You can also find the source code to a demo app, using the said integration layer, [here](https://github.com/echsylon/atlantis-demo).

Feel free to [raise a ticket](https://github.com/echsylon/atlantis/issues) if you find a bug, would like something to change (actually I'd consider buying you a beer if you submit a pull request with a suggested change), or just want to discuss a topic.
